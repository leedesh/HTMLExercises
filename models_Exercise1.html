            In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <strong>Block level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other<br> in normal document flow while <strong>inline</strong> level elements typically appear within the flow of text content.
               
                <h1 style="margin: 20px 0"></h1>
                    In this example the <strong>heading 1</strong> and the paragraphs are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level <br>elements.<br>
                
                <h2 style="margin: 20px 0"></h2>
                    In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <br><strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning</strong>.
