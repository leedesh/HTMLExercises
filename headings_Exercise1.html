                <section> In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</section>

                 <section>Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level<br>heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, <br>what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important <br>to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.</section>

        <h4 style="margin: 20px 0"></h4>
            
            <section>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be <br>used for each individual paragraph.</section>
        
        <h5 style="margin: 20px 0"></h5> 
        <header style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Line breaks</strong></header> 
        <h5 style="margin: 20px 0"></h5>
            <section>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the <br>line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.
            <br>Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate <br>line, but still remained within the same paragraph.
